<h3>Advisor Statement: Guevara Noubir </h3>
<p>Norbert is the lead author and major contributor to this paper. He led the design of the analysis of BLE & Bluetooth Classic stacks exposing a side-channel linkability attack between the two and exposing a globally unique identifier (BDADDR) for both Bluetooth Classic and BLE emissions. This (with corresponding algorithms) led to discovering major security issues with several privacy-preserving protocols that rely on Bluetooth/BLE. The attack, for instance, reveals the BDADDR of devices of infected users of contact-tracing apps (this includes Apple & Google Exposure Notification protocol, the European DP-3T, MIT-LL PACT, etc.). The attack also has implications on various other protocols such as Apple Find My, iBeacon, etc. Norbert led to experimental effort building several testbeds demonstrating the efficiency of the attack against (all) Bluetooth chipsets/phone/apps, and investigated the impact of mobility, and range (60 meters). He also participated in developing some temporary software mitigations (since complete mitigations would require the re-design of Bluetooth chipsets). The attack was disclosed to Apple and Google and received severity rating S2.</p>
